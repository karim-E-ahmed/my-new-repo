## **MCÂ²=E (Materials under Challenging Conditions for Energy Applications)**

We are a research group in the Department of Nuclear Engineering at Texas A&M University.

We develop multiscale and multi-physics models, reduced-order models, and AI/ML tools, to understand and engineer nuclear and energy materials. Our work spans:

- Multiphysics & multiscale modeling of materials in extreme environments
- AI/ML-driven reduced-order models for materials properties and performance
- Advanced nuclear fuels, claddings, and structural materials for advanced reactors
- Materials for Fusion Energy
- Battery Materials
